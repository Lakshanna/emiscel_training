<h3><font color="red">In our opinion, Ubuntu Linux has five main strengths (-over and above the usual Linux ones):</font></h3>
<ol>

    <li>It is arguably the most user-friendly version of Linux out there. Ubuntu's whole philosophy is based around making is easier for the user - hiding any unnecessary complexity behind the scenes</li>

    <li>It has a huge repository of (free) software available - by far the most of any Linux distro</li>

    <li>It has a huge installed base: it's the most popular Linux distro, so there are plenty of people and websites out there supporting it</li>

    <li>It's backed by Canonical, which means that they have the resources to put out six-monthly releases plus bug-fixes</li>

<li>The user-friendliness and choice of available applications available make Ubuntu our recommendation for novice Linux users.
